# Map Short Reads to Genes in Parallel
This script use the Anvi'o function get-short-reads-mapping-to-a-gene to extract all reads associated with a list (single column, tab separated) of Anvi'o caller ids 
A docker installation of Anvi'o is used to parallelize the function. 

### 1. Split your caller id list into multiple files 

```bash
split -l 2000 --numeric-suffixes input_filename output_prefix 
```

### 2. Edit your config file

```bash
cp config.dist config 
nano config
```

Files:

* Gene Lists Directory: Identified single copy core genes arranged into multiple files. The number of gene list files will determine how many containers will be run in parallel.
* Bam Files Direcotry: .bam files generated by bowtie
* DB File: .db file generated by anvio (anvi-gen-contigs database -> .db file)

### 3. Initiate docker layer

```bash
make build
```
Generates paranvio image with anvio docker layer and the entrypoint shell script, with the actual anvio command.

### 4. Run parallel Anvi'o 
```bash
run.sh
```
Runs the bash for loop that creates a series of docker containers, each running anvio. Each container uses one gene list file. run.sh uses shell variables to define the location of the files listed above, as well as an output directory.
